##Problem 1 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

#part a:

Median and Mean departure delay per airport
```{r}
flights %>% group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(count=n(), med_dep_delay = median(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),
            mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>% filter(count > 10) %>%   arrange(,desc(mean_dep_delay))
```

```{r}
flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(count=n(), med_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE),
            mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>% filter(count > 10) %>%   arrange(,desc(mean_arr_delay))
```

#Part b:

How many flights did the aircraft model with the fastest average speed take?
```{r}
flights
planes
airports

planes %>% filter(speed != NA)
```
